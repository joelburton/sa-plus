Reverses
========

Non-jump rebid at 2-level in new suit higher than 1st, 17+p, usually 5+/4+ in 1st/2nd. Forcing.

- `1H-1NT-1S` **not a reverse** (1-level)

- `1S-2C-2H` **not a reverse** (|h| < |s|)

- `1D-1S-2H` **reverse**, 17+p (2-level, |d| < |h|)

- `1D-2C-2H` **reverse** (2-level, |d| < |h|)

  - But: since partner ha shown 10+p, can do with only 15+p, not 17+p

- `1C-1H-2D` **reverse**, 17+p (2-level, |c| < |d|)

  - Because it reverse while being below responder's bid suit

- `1C-1D-2H` **jump-shift**, 19+p

  - For less, `1C-1D-1H`, showing <19p

Reverses are on in competition.


Responding to reverse
---------------------

.. rubric:: Below GF

- Simple preference to opener's 2nd major

- Rebid new 5c major

- w/o major, **Ingberman** `2NT*`: requests opener to rebid 1st suit (aka :title:`Lebensohl after Opener's Reverse`)

  - XXX Would rebid of 1st major be stronger than Ingberman?

- XXX `2NT`, etc, what would this show when using Ingberman

.. rubric:: GF

- `1C-1NT-2D-2HS`: GF, stopper in bid major

- `1D-1NT-2H-3NT`: to play

- `1C-1S-2D-3S`: GF 6+ |s|

- `1D-1S-2H-4D`: GF/slam invite don't want 3NT (`3D` would agree |d| and be GF)

- `1C-1D-2D-2H*`: New suit after fit, asking responder to bid NT w/|h| stopper


.. _rev-by-resp:

Reverses by responder
---------------------

- Like `1C-1D-1NT-2H` shows opening hand or better (GF)

- Responder's 2nd bid is in suit opener passed

- Opener would have to bid at 3-level to give preference to 1st suit, like `3D`

- A rebid with 4th suit is :ref:`fsf` |gf|
