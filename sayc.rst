General & opening
=================

- Can still open 5c M w/NT

- **Diff:** NT openings should be hcp: 15-17, not 14+-17

- **Diff:** `3NT` open is 25-27hcp, not gambling

**Unless noted bid/double by opp cancels convention intended for non-competitive sequence.**


Responding to NT
================

- Still have :ref:`stayman`, :ref:`jacoby-xfer`, :ref:`jacoby-super`, :ref:`jacoby-relay`

- **Diff:** can no longer escape to `2C/2D` with redouble: `1NT-(X)-XX-(p)-2C`

- **Diff:** `1NT-(2C)-X` is not Stayman; any response after overcall is natural

- **Diff:** Responses to `1NT-`

  - `2NT` |inv|: 13-15 |gf|, not 11-12p

  - `3NT` |inv|: 16-18, not 13-15p


Responder
=========

- Strong jump shifts (jump overcalls are preemptive & weak)

- Still :ref:`jacoby-2nt`

- **Diff:** M Limit raises can have 3c (`1H-3H` ok w/3 |h|)

- After 1NT rebid by opener, new suit at next level are NF: `1H-1S-1NT-2C` |inv|

  - Without 1NT rebid, new suit by responder is always forcing unless passed hand

  - To force: responder should reverse or jump-shift

- **Diff:** FSF is |1f|, not |gf|

- Jump raise of opener's first suit to 3L `1S-2C-2H-3S` is |gf|

- Resp promises another bid after 2L new suit (when unpassed or rebid wasn't game): `1S-2C-2D` |1f|

- No forcing minor-suit raise


Overcalls
=========

- 1L overcalls are 8-16p (not 7-17p)

- 2L overcall of M shows 11+p (normally 13+p)

- **Diff:** After overcalling w/1NT, transfers are OFF: `(1S)-1NT-(p)-2H` is natural for |h|

- Still have :ref:`michaels` and :ref:`unusual-2nt`

  - Unclear if can play these mini-max or not


Doubles
=======

- **Diff:** :ref:`x-to` through `4D`, not `4H`

- **Diff:** :ref:`x-neg` through `2S`, not `3S`

- :ref:`truscott-2nt`, :ref:`x-sos`



Balancing
=========

- **Diff:** Balancing w/1NT is 10-15p, not 12-14
