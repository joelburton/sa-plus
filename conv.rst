.. _jacoby-2nt:

Jacoby 2NT
==========

After major opening, responder has GF and 4+c

- Some say: strong 3c is ok, like 2/3 top honors

For example, with `1HS-2NT*`. Openers rebids are:

- Balanced minimum (<=14hcp), no singleton, void, or 2nd 5c+ suit: `"game"*`

- 15-17hcp w/no singleton/void/2nd 5c suit: `3NT*`, slam interest

  - Opener prob is :shape:`5-4-2-2`, or they would have opened `1NT`

- 18+hcp: `"rebid major at 3 level"*`, definite slam interest

- Singleton or void: `"3-level in side suit"*`

- 2nd 5c suit: `"4-level in suit"*`

  - With 2nd 5c suit, has void/singleton; pick better feature


.. _gambling-3nt:

Gambling `3NT*`
===============

A popular convention for hands with a long minor suit, replacing the standard `3NT` bid.
It promises a suit like :suit:`AKQJxxx` (seven cards) or :suit:`AKQxxxxx+` (eight or more).
There should be little power in the side suits (otherwise, a slam could be missed).

.. compound:: **Responses:**

  - `p` if responder can make 2 tricks and has reasonable stoppers in other suits

  - `4C` to "pass or correct"; opener will correct to `4D` if that was their suit

  - `5C/6C/7C` work similarly with lots of strength in opener

  - `4H/4S` is natural, to play


.. _splinter:

Splinter
========

A game-force shape-showing double-jump to agree to a trump suit (w/4+ M or 5+ m).
Can be made by opener/responder. Off if opponents are in auction (big jumps then are preemptive):

`1S-4D`: 4+ |s|, |gf|, void or singleton in diamonds.


.. _major-game-try:

Major game try
==============

After a raise in a major (`1H-2H` or `1S-2S`), opener w/17-18p can request help in deciding to stop in
`3M` or go to `4M`.

- `1H-2H-2NT*`: If resp has 8-10p: `3H` |so|; else `4H` |so|

- `1H-2H-2S*/3C*/3D*` |1f| |conv|:

  - With 9-10p: `4H` |so|

  - With A/K/Q/void/doubleton in suit: `4H` |so|

  - Else decline: `3H` |so|


.. _fsf:

Fourth suit forcing
===================

Intro of only unbid suit at 2-level or higher |gf|. `1C-1D-1H-1S` not FSF; `1C-1D-1H-2S*` is.

.. rubric:: Opener's rebid after FSF

- If responder's 1st suit was major, opener can now show delayed 3c support for it

- NT w/stopper in 4th suit

- Else: DSI (can raise 4th suit to show 4c in it; can rebid a 5c suit)



.. _michaels:

Michaels cuebid
===============

Direct cuebid when opponents have bid only one suit:

- `1H-(2H)`
- `2H-(3H)`: can make over a preempt
- `1H-(p)-p-(2H)`: in balancing seat, still Michaels
- `1H-(p)-1NT-(2H)`: only bid one suit, still Michaels

Not alerted; is "standard"

- If cue is minor, shows 5-5 or better in H+S
- If major, shows 5-5 of better in other M and a minor
- Cuebidding major may force to level-3, so should be a bit stronger
- No required point range; look at value of those 5-5 (9hcp may be fine)
- Mini-maxi: weak or strong; with middle, overcall and try to intro other suit *(not SAYC)*

Responses to Michaels
---------------------

- Preference bid
- Jump preference (preemptive)
- Cuebid of opener suit, game or slam
- New suit, NF
- `2NT`; if cue is major, asks partner to name minor
- `3NT` to play
- `4C` same as 2NT if 2NT not avail; same with 4NT


.. _unusual-2nt:

Unusual Notrump
===============

`1H-(2NT)`

Direct jump to 2NT, showing lower-ranking two unbid. Can also be mini-maxi, like Michaels.

- Not alerted
- `2C-(2NT)` is Unusual (`2C` is artificial), but not `2DHS-(2NT)`, that's just strong `2NT` overcall
- In balance seat, `2NT` isn't Unusual, just strong 19-21hcp, like `1D-(p)-p-(2NT)`

Responses to Unusual Notrump
----------------------------

Same as Michaels (except for `2NT` and `4C`)


.. _cappelletti:

Cappelletti
===========

SAYC doesn't include any 1NT defense; some use this, others Landy or DONT.

Should be <15hcp; if more, double. Can be used in balancing seat. Bids:

- Double  = equivalent hand (was going to open 1NT)
- `2C*` = 1-suit, ~6+c (some play with 5c)
- `2D*` = 5 |h| & 5 |s| (some play w/4-4)
- `2H*` = |h| & a minor
- `2S*` = |s| & a minor
- `2NT*` = both minor
- 3-anything natural

Responses to Cappelletti
------------------------

- Double: keep in if strong; else move to suit
- Can pass `2C*` or `2D*` with 6+ good |c|/|d|
- `2C*-2D*` asks suit, `2HS` w/good 5c, `2NT` is 11+hcp and ok w/any
- `2D*`: `2HS` picks, `2NT*` asks better minor, `3C` is 6+c C, `3HS` invite game w/4+ in suit
- `2HS*`: pass to play, raise 7-10p, new suit natural NF, `2NT*` asks for minor


.. _drury:

Drury
=====

*(This is "Reverse Drury"; classic inverts `-2M/2D` responses.)*

3rd openings can be light; after `p-(p)-1M-(p)-2C*` asks if `1M` was light or legit:

- `-2M`: was light, without lots of strength, should pass

- `-2D`: was legit (13+p)

Special case for `1S`: `1S-(p)-2C*-2H` shows *both* legit `1S` and 4+ |h|.


.. _truscott-2nt:

Truscott 2NT
============

(Also called "Jordan 2NT")

After a T/O double, shows limit+ raise w/4c support: `1H-(X)-2NT` |1f| |conv| shows 10+p and 4+ |h|.

- With a minor, that should be 5c support
