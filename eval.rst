Good suit
=========

A "good suit" has 2/3 :suit:`AKQ` or 3/5 :suit:`AKQJT`

Dummy points
============

*(Some call these "support points")*

When evaluating your hand as dummy *after* a fit found:

- Clear length points, then add dummy points:

  - Void: 5p

  - Singleton: 3p

  - Doubleton: 1p

- Don't count :dfn:`non-working honors` *(ie, singleton Q gets dummy points but not 2 points for Q)*

.. todo sayc book uses 3/2/1 for 3t and 5/3/1 for 4t, which seems sensible
