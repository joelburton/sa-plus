Lead v Notrump
==============

- Lead partners suit

  - :suit:`(?)?`: top of any doubleton

  - :suit:`(J)T7`: top of touching honors

  - No sequence:

    - Didn't support partner suit: low :suit:`K7(5)` or :suit:`85(3)`

    - Supported partner suit: top of nothing :suit:`(5)32` but low from honor: :suit:`(Q)72`

- Own suit

  - Typically, your longest/strongest

    - Avoid leading opponent suits, esp majors

    - If very weak: consider top-of-nothing, hoping to find partner's best suit

  - :suit:`(K)QJx` (3 touching) top of seq (but not A from AKQ; see below)

  - :suit:`(K)QTxx` (broken w/top two touching) still top of seq

  - :suit:`A(J)Tx` (broken interior) top of interior seq

  - :suit:`Hxx(x)`: 4th best

- Ace: lead K from Ace-high: :suit:`A(K)`

  - If :suit:`A` led, means: partner, drop an honor (if not: show count)

    - This helps to figure out if suit can be run & how to do so


Lead v Suit
===========

- Consider suit to lead:

  - Partner's suit: almost always good

  - Trump: passive, helpful to reduce ruffs

    - Good to avoid crossruff (eg, they bid 3 suits until fit)

    - We opened 1NT; reduce their trumps to let your winners win

    - We have long suit and they have 4-4

    - Or: everything else is worse

  - Other: think about auction/hand

  - Singletons can be helpful to get a ruff (doubletons rarely do so)

    - But if your trumps are natural winner: probably don't

    - If partner is very weak: probably won't get ruff

  - Avoid leading from tenace: :suit:`K(J)Tx`

- Picking card:

  - :suit:`(A)x+`: almost never when partner's suit, rarely when unbid suit

    - Never underlead Ace --- if you have to lead this suit, lead Ace

  - :suit:`(?)?`: top of any doubleton

  - :suit:`Hx(x)`: low or 4th best

  - :suit:`(J)Tx` touching: top

  - :suit:`xx(x)` or :suit:`xxx(x)+`: low or 4th best

In order of preference (only go to next if known or irrelevant)

1. **Attitude**: high is good

2. **Count**: hi-low is even, going up is odd

3. **Suit Preference**: low asks lead of lowest non-trump, high is highest non-trump
