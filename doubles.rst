===================
Doubles / Redoubles
===================

.. highlights::

   Types of doubles:

   - :ref:`x-penalty`: they can't make it, we get more points
   - :ref:`x-to`: pick a suit
   - :ref:`x-neg`: pick a suit (after an overcall)
   - :ref:`x-lead`: lead this suit
   - :ref:`x-bal`: made in passout seat, keep alive & protect partner
   - :ref:`x-reopen`: made in passout seat, like a takeout by opener
   - :ref:`x-xx`: this is our hand
   - :ref:`x-sos`: pick another trump choice

.. not now XXX

   - :ref:`x-responsive`: after TO by partner: "partner, pick suit"


.. _x-penalty:

Penalty double
==============

- Doubles of game = penalty (may have lead-directing msg, too)

- Double of 1NT = penalty, responses are

  - Passed: If distributional: pull if weak, jump if 8+p (invites game); else: keep

  - RHO bid: double for penalty, cuebid for takeout, bid, or pass

.. todo::

  Investigate NT-defense, like DONT, which will then make `1NT-X` conventional
  and not penalty


.. _x-to:

Takeout double
==============

.. compound::

  A double is T/O when ALL are true:

  - bidding level is below `4S`

  - doubler's partner has not made call except `p`

  - most recent bid was natural suit bid

.. tip::

  Value hand with dummy points --- you are aiming to be dummy.

.. compound::

  Requirements for "normal" T/O:

  - hand worth opening bid

  - adequate trump support for all unbid suits (at least :suit:`Jxx`)

  - shortness in opponent's suit (at most a doubleton)

.. compound::

  Requirements for "strong 1-suited hand":

  - 18+p and 5+c suit

.. compound::

  Requirements for "too strong to overcall 1NT":

  - 19+p & balanced hand

Advancing T/O by partner
------------------------

- `p` **RARE**: 5+ good cards in opponent suit & strong

  - Good strategy: 3 sure trump tricks & outside :suit:`A/K`

  - If T/O passed: trump lead is mandatory; draw their trumps

- Else **must respond**, unless intervening bid

  1.  Notrump if no 4c major and with stopper(s):

      - 6-10p, 1 stopper in opponent's suit: `"cheapest NT"` |inv|

      - 11-12p, 1½ stoppers (eg :suit:`AQ`): `"jump in NT"` |inv|

      - 13+p, 1½ stoppers: `"3NT"` |inv|

  2.  Else

      - 0-8p: bid longest suit cheaply (tied? prefer major)

      - 9-11p: bid best suit 1 level higher

      = 10+: cuebid opponent suit; "partner, help pick"

      - 12+ bid `4M` |gf|



.. rubric:: If opener's partner bids

.. compound::

  If there's a bid between T/O and you, don't have to bid

  - If you bid: it's a "free bid", promising 8+p

  - Cuebid now is still strong 12+hcp but in *both* unbid


.. rubric:: Rebids by doubler after partnered picked suit:

- "Normal" T/O

  - Pass: 15p or less

  - Raise (need 4+c in suit): 16-18p raise, 19-21p jump raise, 22+p: game

- "One-suited and too strong to overcall" T/O:

  - New suit: 18+ (needs 5+c), stronger & 6+c good suit: jump new suit

  - Cuebid: 19+p, get more information & show strength

- "Too strong to overcall NT"

  - 19-20p `"cheapest NT"`, 21-22p `2NT`, 23+p: `3NT`

Advancing takeout double: `1H-(X)-p-`
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- `1H`: 12-21p, 5+ |h|
- `(X)`: 13+p (counting w/dummy points), 3+c support for |c|\ |d|\ |s| (4 |s| is suggested!)
- `p`: weak

Opponents make T/O
------------------

`1H-(X)-`

- `-1NT` |inv|: 6-9p, no fit

- `XX` |inv|: 10+hcp & tend to deny fit in |h|

- `2H` |inv|: raise (same as usual)

- `3H` |inv|: preemptive w/4c

- `4H` |inv|: preemptive jump raise to game, 5c + weak

- `2NT*` |1f| |conv| = limit raise (:ref:`truscott-2nt`)

- `-1S` |1f| new suit at 1-level

- `-2C` |inv|: new suit at 2-level, w/5+c in |c|

- `-3C` |inv| Jump shift, preemptive


Responder after T/O: `1H-(X)-`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- `1H`: 12-21p, 5+ |h|
- -(X)`: opening-value hand, 3+c in |c|\ |d|\ |s|

  ==================== ============ =========== ================================================


.. _x-lead:

Lead-directing double
=====================

Of artificial bid; be careful doing at low levels (like `1NT-2C*`) unless you have some strength.


.. _x-xx:

Redouble for penalty
====================

- If at 4-level or higher: `1H-3H-4H-(X)-XX`, for penalty

- Of takeout double: `1H-(X)-XX`, 10+p "this is our hand, partner"

- Of double of artificial bid: `1NT-2C-(X)-XX`, for penalty

Be careful not to confuse with :ref:`x-sos`.


.. _x-sos:

SOS redouble
============

After penalty double at 3L or lower and no trump agreed on: "Partner, pick another suit"

- No support for partner's suit (often singleton/void)

- Support for at least two other suits (4+c)

Be careful not to confuse with :ref:`x-xx`.


.. _x-neg:

Negative double
===============

- Partner opens, RHO overcalls (Takeout by responder): `1C-(1D)-X`.
- 1-level: 6+hcp, 2-level: 8+hcp, 3-level: 10+hcp. Don’t have to be short in opponent suit.
- `1C-(1S)-X`: 4+ hearts, not necessarily diamonds
- `1C-(1D)-X` = 4+ in both majors; if only one, would do `1C-(1D)-1HS`
- Played through `3S`

.. rubric:: Responding to Neg Double

- Min rebid: <16p NFl
- Jump rebid: 16-18 NF
- Cue bid opponent suit: 19+p GF
- Pass (rare) penalty


.. _x-bal:

Balancing double
================

See :doc:`balancing`.


.. _x-reopen:

Reopening double
================

- Opener overcalled, partner couldn't double (would be a negative double)

- Like a TO double by opener: `1D-(2C)-p-(p)-X`

- Often good choice if you have singleton/doubleton in overcalled suit
