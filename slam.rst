============
Slam Bidding
============

To make a slam:

1. Can take 12 tricks
2. Have sufficiently strong trump suit
3. In Notrump, all suits stopped
4. Opponents can't take two quick tricks

Ace-asking
==========

Blackwood can help with #3 (RKC can help with #2), cue bidding can help with #3 or #4.

Deciding if `4NT` is Blackwood/RKC: unless partner opened bidding in NT or first rebid was NT.

- `1NT-4NT`: quant raise
- `1S-2D-2NT-4NT`: quant raise
- `1NT-4C`: Gerber
- `1C-1H-2NT-4C` Gerber

To use Blackwood/RKC, must be able to handle any response: if |c| are trump and you have only one Ace,
`4NT-5D` (showing one Ace) would be too high.

Don't use Blackwood/RKC with:

- void suit in declarer
- two quick losers in one suit


.. _blackwood:

Blackwood
=========

In a suit auction, `4NT` is Ace-asking.

- `5C`: 0/4 Aces
- `5D`: 1 Ace
- `5H`: 2 Aces
- `5S`: 3 Aces

A followup of 5NT asks for Kings, with the same system.


.. _rkc:

RKC Blackwood
=============

- Don't use w/worthless doubletons or voids (too risky!)

- Don't use if you won't bid slam missing one ace.

- 5 keycards: As & trump K: |c|\ =03 |d|\ =14 |h|\ =2-no-Q |s|\ =2-yes-Q

- For |c|/|d| responses, queen ask: cheapest non-trump=No, Trump-at-6=Yes, Else=Yes+

  - Example (|h| trump): `4NT-5D-5H-6H` (yes), ``-5S`` (no), ``-6C`` (yes, plus more)

  - Alternative: bid cheapest suit you have K in: `4NT-5D-5H-6C` (have |c|\ K)

- 5NT asks for Kings with standard Blackwood 0-or-4/1/2/3



.. _gerber:

Gerber
======

- `4C` when no trump chosen : 0-or-4/1/2/3, `5C`: same for kings



.. _4nt-quant:

4NT quantitative ask
====================

Are you at high end of your NT bid? 17hcp or 16hcp and a 5c suit, `6NT` or `p`.


.. _5nt-quant:

5NT quantitative ask
====================

Are you at high end of your NT bid? If so, `7NT`; if not, `6NT`.


.. _gsf:

Grand slam force
================

5NT: do you have 2 of 3 of top trump honors? If so, go to 7.


.. _control-bids:

Control bids
============

Bid of new suit *after fit*:

- M trump: above `3M`

- m trump: above `3NT`

1st round: A/void, 2nd: K/singleton/void. Bid up line. Bid at/above game in trump to show nothing.


.. todo:: consider interference of Ace-asking: DOPI/ROPI

  - Overcalled DOPI: Double w/0, pass w/1. Else: up-the-line: next avail suit=2, next=3.

  - Doubled: ROPI: redouble w/0, pass w/1. Same.

  - Some use DEPO for interference above 5-level: double w/even # of aces, pass w/odd.
