Overcalls
=========

**Terminology:** `1S-(2H)-p-(2D)`: `(2H)` is *overcaller*; `(2D)` is *advancer*.

Overcalling
===========

Overcalling in NT
-----------------

**Overcalling 1NT:** balanced, stopper in opponent's suit, 15-18p.

- Stayman and transfer are on


Overcalling suit
----------------

- 1-level: 7-17p & good 5+c (|nv| ok: 4c of exceptional quality)

- 2-level: 13-17p & good 5+c (looser req w/6c)

With two 5c suits, choose higher, like opening.

.. tip::

  For on-the-cusp overcalls, they may end up declaring,
  so think: "do I want my partner to lead this suit?" If not, consider not overcalling.


Preemptive jump overcall
------------------------

- 2-level: weak hand, good 6c suit

- 3-level: weak hand, good 7c suit

- 4-level: weal hand, good 8c suit

.. topic:: Rule of 500 for PJOs

  Comparing potential loss vs opponents making game:
  |nv|: 3 down, |v|: 2 down


Advancing overcall
==================

Responding to overcall: `1C-(1H)-p`

Can pass with very strong in opponent suit or has no good bid --- partner can bid again.


.. rubric:: With support 3+c

Add :ref:`dummy-pts`

- 0-9p and 4c support: jump raise, preemptive: `-(3H)` |inv|

  - with 5+c support, to game, preemptive: `-(4H)` |inv|

- 6-9p and 3c support: raise: `-(2H)` |inv|

- 10+p: :ref:`cuebid` opponent suit: `-(2C)` |1f| |conv|

.. rubric:: Without support

- New suit good 5+c or any 6+c

  - 6+p: 1L, `-(1S)` |inv|

  - 11+p: 2L, `-(2D)` |inv|

- :ref:`x-neg` `X` |conv| --- shows 4+c in |d| & |s|

  - 6+p: 1L

  - 11+p: 2L

.. rubric:: In NT

After overcall, `2NT` is **not** :ref:`jacoby-2nt`

- 7-11p: cheapest NT: `-(1NT)` |inv|

- 12-14p: jump in NT: `-(2NT)` |inv|

- 15+: cuebid, then bid NT: `-(2C)-(??)-2NT/3NT` |inv|

Overcalls after `1D-` open
--------------------------

- `1D`: 12-21p, 3+ |d| (almost certainly 4+)

Reacting to opp overcall
========================

- Make same response as would w/o overcall:

  - `1C-(1H)-1S` (now shows 5+c, see below)

  - `1C-(1H)-2C` (same)

  - `1C-(1H)-1NT`: *now promises balanced*, 6-10p, now promises stopper in |h|

- Suitable alternative if response interfered with

- New options:

  - Jump raise of opener is **preemptive**, weak 0-9p, 4+c support: `1C-(1H)-3C`

  - Cuebid overcall shows limit+ raise in |c|: `1C-(1H)-2H`, see :ref:`cuebid`

  - :ref:`x-neg`

  - `1D-(1H)-X`: shows exactly 4 |s| (if there were 5, would overcall with `1S`)

    - Or: could be too strong for overcall and going "through" takeout double

Examples
--------

Response after `1D-(1S)`
++++++++++++++++++++++++

- `1D`: 12-21p & 3+ |c| *(almost always 4+)*

- `-(1S)`: 7-17p, 5+ |s|
