Preempts
========

Opening
=======

- `2D/2H/2S`: 5-10p, good 6+c suit, ~5 tricks |nv| or ~6 |v|

  - You may not have a side 4+c major

- `3C/3D/3H/3S`: < open, 7+c good suit, ~6 tricks |nv| or ~7 |v|

- `4C/4D/4H/4S`: < open, 8+c good suit, ~7 tricks |nv| or ~8 |v|

- `5C/5D`: < open, 9+c good suit, ~8 tricks |nv| or ~9 |v|


**Don't preempt after an opponent's preempt.**


.. rubric:: 3rd seat

Can relax rules about length + suit strength in 3rd seat. Be frisky!

.. rubric:: 4th seat

Don't bid a week two in 4th seat --- just pass for a new hand.

Therefore `2DHS` in 4th seat **isn't weak** --- it is a tactical bid
showing 13-15p and a 6+c suit.


Responding
==========

1.  Count tricks

    - if likely enough, bid game

    - With no fit, don't get too high, even w/good hand

2.  Count trumps

    - Raise to L = total-of-trumps (LAW)

3.  Make forcing bid

    - New suit below game: 13+p and 5+c suit (6+c requires fewer points)

    - over `2DHS`: can use `2NT*` |1f| |conv| "feature ask", responses are:

      - Minimum (5-7p): rebid suit at 3L

      - 8-10p: bid outside A/K or `3NT` solid suit

        - XXX: what to do w/8-10 no AK and not solid suit

    - `4NT`: :ref:`rkc`

    - `5NT`: :ref:`gsf`

**Overcall preempts** (not with preempts) --- your partner will have some points.
