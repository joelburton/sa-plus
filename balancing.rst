=========
Balancing
=========

- Opps stop bidding at low level: In passout seat: can overbid by 3pt ("borrow a King")

- Since can overbid by 3pt, for "normal" overcalls: start with double, then do as normal

- Don't balance with strong holding in opponent suit: this might help them find a better suit

Choices
=======

- Double: takeout
- NT: `1NT` 12-14hcp, `2NT` 19-21hcp (not Unusual), Double followed by min NT: 15-18hcp
- Jump in suit: opening count (NOT weak, like in direct seat)
- Cuebid: :ref:`michaels`
- `p`: "trap pass" (you're strong in their suit; hopefully, partner doubles)

Responding
==========

To balancing overcall
---------------------

(adjusted by +3p, since balance can be light)

- NT: `1NT`: 9-12p, `2NT`: 12-14p, `3NT`: 15+p
- Have decent control of opponent suit & tolerance for partner suit

To balancing NT
---------------

(adjust by +3p): systems on

Examples
========

- :hand:`864 A7 KJ96 AT84` `1D-(p)-p-(1NT)` (12p in range for balancing 1NT)
- :hand:`K42 K8652 8 J952` `1D-(p)-p-(1H)` (can using 3p to make hearts stronger)
- :hand:`T873 AJ83 82 KQ8` `1D-(p)-p-(X)` (+3p gets in T/O double range)
- :hand:`KQ8 A8 KQ84 KT73` `1D-(p)-p-(X)-` (double then NT)
